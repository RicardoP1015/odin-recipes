This is a simple show of my html skills with a basic recipes catalog having three different recipes.
Sorted in both unordered and ordered lists for instructions and need ingredients and being able to link to different html files.
I am also taking the odin project to sharpen my coding skills overall as i still have lot of imposter syndrome and even with some projects already 
done I still feel that I barely understand what ive done hopefully once im done with the odin project ill have more confidence.
